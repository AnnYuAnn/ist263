        <main>
        <p>
            I am a senior majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and minoring in <strong>Psychology </strong> at Syracuse University. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I took a wide range of courses in computer science, ranging from fundamental algorithms to advanced artificial intelligence. 
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Structure</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Systems and Network Programming</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Automata Computability </strong></li>
                <li><strong>Mobile Application Programming</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Analysis Algorithms</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        <p>
            In my opinion, psychology and computer science can be combined through <strong>HCI</strong>; 
            it’s application in technological development and use, and developmental psychology and social theory provide challenges 
            for testing and improvement. It extends from the root of individual users' cognitive processes, to the social and organizational 
            processes involving computers in the virtual environment, and the use of computers in collaboration.

        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            Since I was young, I have loved dancing very much and have won many awards. I organized and rehearsed various activities in the school,
            and I was lucky to be able to perform dances at Carnegie Hall in my senior year. However, the constant pain forced me to give up the 
            idea of ​​becoming a professional dancer.
