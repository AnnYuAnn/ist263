        I am a senior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Psychology at Syracuse University. 
        I took a wide range of courses in computer science, ranging from fundamental algorithms to advanced artificial intelligence.
        Since I was young, I have loved dancing very much and have won many awards. I organized and rehearsed various activities in the school, and I was lucky to be able to perform dances at Carnegie Hall in my senior year. However, the constant pain forced me to give up the idea of ​​becoming a professional dancer.
